* GRINS::Solver now reads from an input file and initializes
  solver options.
* Created GRINS::MeshManager class to handle operations on 
  libMesh::Mesh objects.
* GRINS::MeshManager reads options from an input file.
* GRINS::Solver.solve() outline in place.
* Stubs created in GRINS::LowMachNumberNavierStokesSystem
  class.
* GRINS::Solver writes out mesh and system information
  via libMesh methods. Successfully tested with ExodusII
  format and ParaView.

Version 0.0.0
* Autotools build system put in place.
* Links with libMesh.
