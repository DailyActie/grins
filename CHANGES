Version 0.3.0 (In progress)

Version 0.2.0
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/grins/code/tags/0.2.0

  * Include GPL licensing and auto-update header mechanism
  * Designed MultiphysicsSystem class to interface with FEMSystem. Each physics
    is implemented as a subclass of Physics.
  * Implemented and tested the following physics: incompressible Navier-Stokes,
    heat transfer (neglecting viscous dissipation), Boussinesq buoyancy, all with
    their axisymmetric counter parts.
  * Setup generic BoundaryConditions class for all physics classes to leverage for
    implementing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
  * Incorporated Doxygen documentation and setup initial pages describing installation
    and an example input file.
  * Incorporated GRVY as an optional library to use for performance timing.
  * Added capability for visualizing element residuals for each physics components,
    both steady and unsteady.
  * Code is stated to currently build and run with libMesh r4887.

Version 0.1.0
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/grins/code/tags/0.1.0
  
  * GRINS::Solver now reads from an input file and initializes solver options
  * Created GRINS::MeshManager class to handle operations on libMesh::Mesh objects
  * GRINS::MeshManager reads options from an input file
  * GRINS::Solver.solve() outline in place
  * Stubs created in GRINS::LowMachNumberNavierStokesSystem class
  * GRINS::Solver writes out mesh and system information via libMesh methods. Successfully tested with ExodusII
    format and ParaView
